1. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

2. IllegalArgumentException - Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.

3. IOException - Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.
This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations.

4. StackOverflowError - Thrown when a stack overflow occurs because an application recurses too deeply.

5. OutOfMemoryError - Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate an object because it is out of memory,
and no more memory could be made available by the garbage collector. OutOfMemoryError objects may be constructed
by the virtual machine as if suppression were disabled and/or the stack trace was not writable.

the numeric types, but that the string does not have the appropriate format.
